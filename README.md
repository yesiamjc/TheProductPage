# Geekyness Technical Assessment for Frontend Developer & Designer Intern

## Process: 

I've tried to implement the web page. An e-Commerce website. I've used four cards for that development.Android, ios and of course,full stack and I have also handed the related pages and the reviews section and the footer section and also give the filters by category & filter by sorting. And I also have given the navbar with the logo and the search bar submit button and in the right side login button and the cart icon.
